HSM Retroarch Alpha

The exe here is an compile I have done locally with changes required for the Mega Bezel to run properly
It requires the QT files to be copied into the Retroarch folder
Take files from the QT files zip and copy them over top your Retroarch Folder
Take your retroarch.exe and rename it (So you can go back to it if you need to), then copy the retroarch.exe from this folder into your retroarch folder
