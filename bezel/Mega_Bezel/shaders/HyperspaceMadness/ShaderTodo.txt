Mega Bezel is updated to V 0.9.08 2021-04-26

Changes:
*  Fixed Black-Only cropping to leave lit pixels right at the edge
*  Fixed Upside down error with 3DS Advanced
*  Added Standard 3DS preset (Uses Guest-DrVenom instead of LCD)
*  Dual Screen 2nd Screen Sides Cropping uses percentage
 *  This allows you to change the core resolution to 2x etc and have the crop be correct on the bottom screen
 *  Brings up the question of if the regular cropping should be in percentage as well
*  Fixed Resolution Debug text to stay smaller longer so it doesn't' get clipped off
*  Fixed ADVANCED Bezel Curvature Mode

*  Performance of Base presets at 3840x2160 on Nvidia RTX2060:
  *  ADVANCED -                      80 FPS  -  No comparable old preset

  *  BASIC-BORDER-WITH-REFLECTION - 175 FPS  -  Old Reflect Only Preset 165 FPS
  *  BASIC-BORDER -                 295 FPS  -  Old Screen Scale Preset 370 FPS

Mega Bezel Still to Come:

V1 TODO
  * ADVANCED Fix Optional curvature for following Bezel Scale
  * Black Edge should be scaled with relation to screen height 
  * Fix black line around the frame when shadow is on, Advanced only?
  * Fix frame inner edge color not picking up HSV, (Advanced Preset?)
  * Fix bright area of screen showing outside the black line when bezel is hidden
  * Fix LCD Shader
  * Viewport orientation Debug
  * Night Lighting Add Scaling
  * Add Cutout to STANDARD Preset?
  * Inverse Cutout on Frame/Bezel? Shadow from Cutout?
  * Need an Preset for HD content, Vector Content
  * Local vs FullScreen Blur on Corner reflection?
  * HSV for Background for ADVANCED?
  * Logo
    * Put Logo on Screen 1 & Scale Properly, options for which screen?
    * Position offset?
  * Dual Screen
    * Combine frame shadows
  * Square Pixels Preset? Trigger Res, Scanline Opacity, Turn Off Mask, or use CGWG then turn “0 & 7 Strength” to 0.00.
  * First Pass for Downscaling, Anti-Flicker needs to go here because of OriginalHistory1
  * Add Downscale res to res debug
  * HD-CORE presets
  * Add Mode to show masks and color for output for a basic-border preset
  * Add Images and Readme to root of the Repo
  * Update Doc Readme


Examples
  * Punch Out - Dual Screen

  * Add Gameboy Palettes https://www.deviantart.com/thewolfbunny/gallery/69987002/game-boy-palettes
  * Split background (Background and Bezel image?) and shift halves to far left and right
  * Add Sharp Pixel Preset - No CRT Processing, Options for reflection area, Adjustable Quilez Sharpening?
  * Independent Bezel Scaling not the same as non-int scale, why? Maybe only in Portrait Res
  * Need x Scale for screen size of Independent bezel
  * Outer reflection corner radius should be independent when in independent mode
  * See why very inner edge seems not affected by reflection mask
  * Startup Animation - Sprite Sheet
  * Bilinear scale option per layer?
  * Add Shadow for Image Cutout
  * Frame Shading
    * Shading on frame interior edge?
    * Frame Inner edge static lighter line
    * Frame Interior Edge thickness
    * Fix shading with rounded outer corner
    * Frame shadow should follow corner radius
  * Integer Scale Guides
  * Source Image Passthrough on CRT Pass, for straight bilinear from core image
  * Gameboy
    * Fix DMG Shader
    * Fix Low Contrast Issue
    * Multiple palettes including Custom for Gameboy
  * Reflection fade option to have reflection come to 100% at inner frame boundary so you can have a glass like effect outside the bezel
  * Per Layer Scaling of Cutout?
  * Noise Sampling on Tube Highlight
  * Aspect Ratio on Images, test if we can get it from the image, DX11 might work
  * When reflection is off still see inner bezel edge reflection
  * Guess Resolution for Core Sampling Multiplier?, Set target vertical downsampled resolution, try to get multiple.
  * Move Resolution Debug to be top justified
  * Reflection on Control Panel and Speaker Panel

  * Black edge should scale with tube (It's much larger when the tube scaling is smaller)
  
  * Add Deconvergence (Dogway Glass?)
  * Simulated Gamma & Display Gamma
  * Calibrate brightness of crt shaders & LCD to Guest-Venom

  * Put Torridgristle LUT back in for blue skys

  * Scanlines
    * Get GTU to respect scanline direction
    * Fake Scanline improvements
      * Parameterized scanline behavior, thickness etc
      * Implement Rolling scanlines & interference similar to Newpixie-Crt
  * Auto Aspect Ratio
    *  Bloody Roar II and Tobal 2, Tekken 3 and R4 (Tekken 3 & 4 are registering as vertical)
  * Color Management/Correction
    * Brightness balance the presets so they are consistent, some are currently brighter than others
  * Add some standard deconvergence which can be used with the rolling scanlines
  * Reflection on areas outside the frame, e.g. Arcade Speaker Panel and Control Panel
  * Optimize presets using non-float frame buffers
  * Independent frame scaling?

Retroarch Features
  * Shader Textures in Sub Menu - Add ability to set texture overrides in retroarch UI
  * Shader Passes in Sub Menu
  * Add Preset to beginning of chain (Autechre's request )
  * Next/Previous Shader sometimes uses different directories, probably related to shader_path in live shader rather than originally loaded preset
  * Replace Text, for shader type, game & core, content directory
    core_name
    game_name
    [shadertype], [gamename], [corename], [contentdirectory]
    * Check textures and use default if not found
  * Multiple references in one file for adding passes and parameter overrides
  * Add Shader Preset - In UI Add a shader preset to Concatenate passes at beginning of shader stack
  * Fix loss of current parameter values when retroarch goes from full screen to window
  * Fix MyTextureNameSize for textures
  * Add History other than OriginalHistory1 ...
  * Fix <texture>Size, only works for textures in DX11, 12, not Vulkan
  * Video Aspect Ratio which uses Monitor
  * Stop Reloading Shader multiple times on Save (Keep optional param)
  * GIF support


  Notes:
  Fake Scanlines
    Parameter for simulated line count
    Option to try to match a integer division of the core resolution
    Option for integer "perfect" scanlines
    Offset on scan axis
    Curvature Multiplier
    Try mame hlsl darkening
    Check Lottes tone mapping
    Crawl

  Super Glow HighFX Version?, manage brightness
