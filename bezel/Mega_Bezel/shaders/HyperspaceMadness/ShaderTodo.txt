Mega Bezel is updated to V 2020-XX-XX

Changes:
  All Presets
  * New preset organization with 4 base preset types
    * ADVANCED - Includes extra image layers which can be reordered and scaled
    * STANDARD - Standard Mega Bezel features
    * GLASS - Fills screen with glass like reflection image, same performance as STANDARD preset
    * BASIC-BORDER - Has only the Background Layer and no autogenerated bezel, can be a replacement for standard retroarch overlay
  * Royale Removed
  * Glass Presets is now faster
  * Colored Gel Image
    * Used for games like Battlezone where white screen graphics are colored by a gel
  * Backdrop type image blending
    * Used to add screen on top of background art, E.G. Tron, Space Invaders
  * NightMode 
    * Renamed to NightLighting
    * Applied properly to all images
  * Static Gamma now properly applied to all images
  * Added Frame Highlight with @duimon's highlight graphic
  * Added Header/Title Params for section breaks
  * LCD preset fixed artifacts in screen and in reflection, LCD can now use cropping
  * Guest-SM Garbage Pixels fixed
  * Negative Cropping (for adding extra black at screen edges) Removed due to performance cost
  * Fixed Moire appearing in reflection, more noticeable in glass preset
  * Independent curvature for bezel & screen
  * Scaling of 'reflection' to have similar effect to Big Blur, interesting for driving games
  * All internal parameter names have changed

  ADVANCED Presets:
  * Image Layers
    * You can change the layering order of each image layer
    * Added Features per Image Layer
      * Scaling Mode
      * Blending mode
      * Mask Mode
    * Almost all layers have the same controls
    * Added Image Layers
      * Bezel Image
        * HSV adjustment
      * Cabinet Glass
    * Added Layer Ordering
    * NightMode
      * Add Saturation & HSV control to NightLighting
    * Image Cutout for Top Image

  *  Performance of Base presets at 3840x2160 on Nvidia RTX2060:
    *  

Mega Bezel Still to Come:

  * Aspect Ratio Control for second screen
  * Crop for second screen
  * Set Core Image Split Position
  * Combine Dual screen shadows
  * Add Images and Readme to root of the Repo
  * Update Doc Readme
  * Add Cutout to Simple Preset? 
  * Inverse Cutout on Frame/Bezel? Shadow from Cutout?
  * Add Sharp Pixel Preset - No CRT Processing, Options for reflection area, Adjustable Quilez Sharpening?
  * Independent Bezel Scaling not the same as non-int scale, why? Maybe only in Portrait Res
  * Need x Scale for screen size of Independent bezel
  * Outer reflection corner radius should be independent when in independent mode
  * See why very inner edge seems not affected by reflection mask
  * Strange Inner edge brightness 
  * Examples
    * Cutout Bezel
    * Vertical Example - Full Adjustable, Plastic Bezel
    * Discs of Tron
  * Startup Animation - Sprite Sheet
  * Bilinear scale option per layer?
  * Redo Splitscreen with mapping and no dependence on sampling
  * Add Shadow for Image Cutout
  * Frame Shading
    * Shading on frame interior edge?
    * Frame Inner edge static lighter line
    * Frame Interior Edge thickness
    * Fix shading with rounded outer corner
    * Frame shadow should follow corner radius
  * Integer Scale Guides
  * Source Image Passthrough on CRT Pass, for straight bilinear from core image
  * Gameboy
    * Fix Low Contrast Issue
    * Multiple palettes including Custom for Gameboy
  * Reflection fade option to have reflection come to 100% at inner frame boundary so you can have a glass like effect outside the bezel
  * Per Layer Scaling of Cutout?
  * Noise Sampling on Tube Highlight
  * Aspect Ratio on Images, test if we can get it from the image, DX11 might work
  * When reflection is off still see inner bezel edge reflection
  * Guess Resolution for Core Sampling Multiplier?, Set target vertical downsampled resolution, try to get multiple.
  * Move Resolution Debug to be top justified

  * Black edge should scale with tube (It's much larger when the tube scaling is smaller)
  
  *  Add Deconvergence (Dogway Glass?)
  * Simulated Gamma & Display Gamma
  * Calibrate brightness of crt shaders & LCD to Guest-Venom

  * Put Torridgristle LUT back in for blue skys

  * Scanlines
    * Get GTU to respect scanline direction
    * Fake Scanline improvements
      * Parameterized scanline behavior, thickness etc
      * Implement Rolling scanlines & interference similar to Newpixie-Crt
  * Auto Aspect Ratio
    *  Bloody Roar II and Tobal 2, Tekken 3 and R4 (Tekken 3 & 4 are registering as vertical)
  * Color Management/Correction
    * Brightness balance the presets so they are consistent, some are currently brighter than others
  * Split Screen
    * Autodetect Split Screen
    * Split screen working with Citra Side by side (Control of Split Center)
    * Split screen with small second screen as small on right
    * Split screen fix center area between bezels with tilt
    * Options for Core Output, then shader defines final layout
  * CRT-Geom-Deluxe Preset
  * Royale - Add Sampling support for cropping & downsampling behavior
  * Add some standard deconvergence which can be used with the rolling scanlines
  * Screen Scale Newpixie
  * Reflection on areas outside the frame, e.g. Arcade Speaker Panel and Control Panel
  * Optimize presets using non-float frame buffers
  * Independent frame scaling?
  * Find way to do textureSize so we don't have to define texture aspect in parameters

Retroarch Features

  * Replace Text, for shader type, game & core, content directory
    core_name
    game_name
    [shadertype], [gamename], [corename], [contentdirectory]
    * Check textures and use default if not found
  * Shader Passes in Sub Menu
  * Shader Textures in Sub Menu - Add ability to set texture overrides in retroarch UI
  * Multiple references in one file for adding passes and parameter overrides
  * Add Shader Preset - In UI Add a shader preset to Concatenate passes at beginning of shader stack
  * Fix loss of current parameter values when retroarch goes from full screen to window
  * Fix MyTextureNameSize for textures
  * Add History other than OriginalHistory1 ...

  * Video Aspect Ratio which uses Monitor
  * Stop Reloading Shader multiple times on Save (Keep optional param)
  * GIF support


  Notes:
  Fake Scanlines
    Parameter for simulated line count
    Option to try to match a integer division of the core resolution
    Option for integer "perfect" scanlines
    Offset on scan axis
