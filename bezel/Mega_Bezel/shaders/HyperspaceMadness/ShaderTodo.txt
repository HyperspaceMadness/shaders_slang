Mega Bezel is updated to V 2020-XX-XX

Changes:
  All Presets
  * Requires Retroarch 1.9.1
  * RetroArch 1.9.1  has the Simple Presets feature which you should use for saving your presets
    * Saving with this feature allows the Mega Bezel presets & shaders to be updated without breaking the presets you have saved
    * These presets will be much simpler inside, they only include the changed parameters and textures
  * New preset organization with 4 base preset types
    * ADVANCED - Includes extra image layers which can be reordered and scaled
    * STANDARD - Standard Mega Bezel features
    * GLASS - Fills screen with glass like reflection image, same performance as STANDARD preset
    * BASIC-BORDER - Has only the Background Layer and no autogenerated bezel, can be a replacement for standard retroarch overlay
  * Presets Reorganized so only 4 presets are in the base preset folder
    * The default presets use  @guest.r's awesome Guest-DrVenom shader
    * Presets with specific crt shaders are in the Base_CRT_Presets folder
  * Readme has been updated to have description the parameters (Hopefully all of them)
  * Sadly, Royale preset has been removed :(
    * Put a lot of thought into this and decided to remove Royale because:
      * Royale was very difficult to maintain when new features are added
      * It was already missing a few features
  * Glass Presets is probably faster
    * I need to do a direct speed comparison to say definitively
  * All internal parameter names have changed, but will stay stable from now on
    * One exception is the dual Screen parameter names might need to change a bit since it's newly implemented
  * Dual Screen Mode
    * Now available for all presets and doesn't have a performance impact
    * A lot more flexibility and control over screen placement, scaling and cropping
    * Can do a proper 3DS preset with the different screen resolutions & aspect ratios
  * New Start Up Animation (You can change the image if desired)
  * Colored Gel Image
    * Used for games like Battlezone where white screen graphics are colored by a gel
  * Backdrop type image blending
    * Used to add screen on top of background art, E.G. Tron, Space Invaders, Boot Hill
  * NightMode 
    * Renamed to NightLighting
    * Applied properly to all images
  * Static Gamma now properly applied to all images
  * Frame Highlight with @duimon's highlight graphic
    * Gives a more dimensional feel to the frame
  * Added Header/Title Params for section breaks
  * LCD preset fixed artifacts in screen and in reflection, LCD can now use cropping
  * Guest-SM Garbage Pixels fixed
  * Fixed Moire appearing in reflection, more noticeable in glass preset
  * Independent curvature for bezel & screen so you can change the screen size without affecting the bezel
  * Reflection
    * Scaling of 'reflection' to have similar effect to Big Blur, interesting for driving games
    * Reflection Mask image so an image can be used to mask the reflection with a texture
      * A good example of this is when putting the reflection over top of a plastic textured bezel

  ADVANCED Presets:
  * Image Layers
    * You can change the layering order of each image layer
    * Added Features per Image Layer
      * Scaling Mode
      * Blending mode
      * Mask Mode
    * Almost all layers have the same controls
    * Added Image Layers
      * Bezel Image
        * HSV adjustment
      * Cabinet Glass
    * Added Layer Ordering
    * NightMode
      * Add Saturation & HSV control to NightLighting
    * Image Cutout for Top Image

  *  Performance of Base presets at 3840x2160 on Nvidia RTX2060:
    *  ADVANCED -      80 FPS
    *  GLASS -        150 FPS
    *  STANDARD -     135 FPS
    *  BASIC-BORDER - 295 FPS

Mega Bezel Still to Come:

  * Shift Intro to the end?
  * Fix frame inner edge color not picking up HSV, (Advanced Preset?)
  * Fix STANDARD Image Aspect when it is 9:16
  * Fix bright area of screen showing outside the black line when bezel is hidde
  * HSV for Background?
  * Dual Screen
    * Put Logo on Screen 1
    * Combine frame shadows
  * Add Mode to show masks and color for output for a basic-border preset
  * Performance test a Reflection Only preset
  * Add Images and Readme to root of the Repo
  * Update Doc Readme
  * Add Cutout to Simple Preset? 
  * Inverse Cutout on Frame/Bezel? Shadow from Cutout?
  * Add Sharp Pixel Preset - No CRT Processing, Options for reflection area, Adjustable Quilez Sharpening?
  * Independent Bezel Scaling not the same as non-int scale, why? Maybe only in Portrait Res
  * Need x Scale for screen size of Independent bezel
  * Outer reflection corner radius should be independent when in independent mode
  * See why very inner edge seems not affected by reflection mask
  * Strange Inner edge brightness 
  * Examples
    * Cutout Bezel
    * Vertical Example - Full Adjustable, Plastic Bezel
    * Discs of Tron
  * Startup Animation - Sprite Sheet
  * Bilinear scale option per layer?
  * Redo Splitscreen with mapping and no dependence on sampling
  * Add Shadow for Image Cutout
  * Frame Shading
    * Shading on frame interior edge?
    * Frame Inner edge static lighter line
    * Frame Interior Edge thickness
    * Fix shading with rounded outer corner
    * Frame shadow should follow corner radius
  * Integer Scale Guides
  * Source Image Passthrough on CRT Pass, for straight bilinear from core image
  * Gameboy
    * Fix Low Contrast Issue
    * Multiple palettes including Custom for Gameboy
  * Reflection fade option to have reflection come to 100% at inner frame boundary so you can have a glass like effect outside the bezel
  * Per Layer Scaling of Cutout?
  * Noise Sampling on Tube Highlight
  * Aspect Ratio on Images, test if we can get it from the image, DX11 might work
  * When reflection is off still see inner bezel edge reflection
  * Guess Resolution for Core Sampling Multiplier?, Set target vertical downsampled resolution, try to get multiple.
  * Move Resolution Debug to be top justified

  * Black edge should scale with tube (It's much larger when the tube scaling is smaller)
  
  *  Add Deconvergence (Dogway Glass?)
  * Simulated Gamma & Display Gamma
  * Calibrate brightness of crt shaders & LCD to Guest-Venom

  * Put Torridgristle LUT back in for blue skys

    * Get GTU to respect scanline direction
    * Fake Scanline improvements
      * Parameterized scanline behavior, thickness etc
      * Implement Rolling scanlines & interference similar to Newpixie-Crt
  * Auto Aspect Ratio
    *  Bloody Roar II and Tobal 2, Tekken 3 and R4 (Tekken 3 & 4 are registering as vertical)
  * Color Management/Correction
    * Brightness balance the presets so they are consistent, some are currently brighter than others
  * Split Screen
    * Autodetect Split Screen
    * Split screen working with Citra Side by side (Control of Split Center)
    * Split screen with small second screen as small on right
    * Split screen fix center area between bezels with tilt
    * Options for Core Output, then shader defines final layout
  * CRT-Geom-Deluxe Preset
  * Royale - Add Sampling support for cropping & downsampling behavior
  * Add some standard deconvergence which can be used with the rolling scanlines
  * Screen Scale Newpixie
  * Reflection on areas outside the frame, e.g. Arcade Speaker Panel and Control Panel
  * Optimize presets using non-float frame buffers
  * Independent frame scaling?
  * Find way to do textureSize so we don't have to define texture aspect in parameters

Retroarch Features
