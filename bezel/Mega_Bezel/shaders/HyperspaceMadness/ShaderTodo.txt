Mega Bezel is updated to V 0.9.017 2021-06-12

Changes:
  * 3DS
    * Fixed Basic Preset
    * Added Dual-Screen-3DS__STD__DREZ-3DS-400x480.slangp to Variations
      * This uses MBZ__2__STANDARD__DREZ-3DS-400x480__GUEST-DrVENOM.slangp in Base_CRT_Presets
      * This preset allows you to run the standard mega bezel while running citra at which ever internal resolution desired
      * So you can run it at 4x for example and it will downres to standard 3ds resolution with anti-aliasing you were getting from the 4X res
  * Down res
    * MBZ__2__STANDARD__DREZ-240p__GUEST-DrVENOM.slangp added for downrezing in the first pass to 240p
      * Good for games like MVC2 on Dreamcast
    * Added Marvel Vs Capcom 2 preset SegaDC-MVC2__STD__DEREZ-480p.slangp 


*  Performance of Base presets at 3840x2160 on Nvidia RTX2060:

  *  GLASS -                        150 FPS  -  Old Glass Preset        128 FPS
  *  STANDARD -                     135 FPS  -  Old Full Preset         140 FPS

Post V1  
  * Do Hylian Sync Version
  * Night light single glow - Place Glows


Examples
  * Guest ADV - Deconvergence before CRT? 2 Passes, one before one after and switch?
  * Punch Out - Dual Screen
  * Vector Preset
  * Use MipMaps for image sampling when we have the image texture sizes
  * Add Gameboy Palettes https://www.deviantart.com/thewolfbunny/gallery/69987002/game-boy-palettes
  * Split background (Background and Bezel image?) and shift halves to far left and right
  * Add Sharp Pixel Preset - No CRT Processing, Options for reflection area, Adjustable Quilez Sharpening?
  * Independent Bezel Scaling not the same as non-int scale, why? Maybe only in Portrait Res
  * Need x Scale for screen size of Independent bezel
  * Outer reflection corner radius should be independent when in independent mode
  * See why very inner edge seems not affected by reflection mask
  * Startup Animation - Sprite Sheet
  * Bilinear scale option per layer?
  * Add Shadow for Image Cutout
  * Frame Shading
    * Shading on frame interior edge?
    * Frame Inner edge static lighter line
    * Frame Interior Edge thickness
    * Fix shading with rounded outer corner
    * Frame shadow should follow corner radius
  * Integer Scale Guides
  * Source Image Passthrough on CRT Pass, for straight bilinear from core image
  * Gameboy
    * Fix DMG Shader
    * Fix Low Contrast Issue
    * Multiple palettes including Custom for Gameboy
  * Reflection fade option to have reflection come to 100% at inner frame boundary so you can have a glass like effect outside the bezel
  * Per Layer Scaling of Cutout?
  * Noise Sampling on Tube Highlight
  * Aspect Ratio on Images, test if we can get it from the image, DX11 might work
  * When reflection is off still see inner bezel edge reflection
  * Guess Resolution for Core Sampling Multiplier?, Set target vertical downsampled resolution, try to get multiple.
  * Move Resolution Debug to be top justified
  * Reflection on Control Panel and Speaker Panel

  * Black edge should scale with tube (It's much larger when the tube scaling is smaller)
  
  * Add Deconvergence (Dogway Glass?)
  * Simulated Gamma & Display Gamma
  * Calibrate brightness of crt shaders & LCD to Guest-Venom

  * Put Torridgristle LUT back in for blue skys

  * Scanlines
    * Get GTU to respect scanline direction
    * Fake Scanline improvements
      * Parameterized scanline behavior, thickness etc
      * Implement Rolling scanlines & interference similar to Newpixie-Crt
  * Auto Aspect Ratio
    *  Bloody Roar II and Tobal 2, Tekken 3 and R4 (Tekken 3 & 4 are registering as vertical)
  * Color Management/Correction
    * Brightness balance the presets so they are consistent, some are currently brighter than others
  * Add some standard deconvergence which can be used with the rolling scanlines
  * Reflection on areas outside the frame, e.g. Arcade Speaker Panel and Control Panel
  * Optimize presets using non-float frame buffers
  * Independent frame scaling?

Documentation
  Setup
    Turn off video rotation 

  Troubleshooting 
    New install of retroarch 
    Turn all overlays off 
    I have rings, wavy distortions (Moire)

  Vertical Arcade game setup
    FBNeo
    Mame 2003
    Mame 2010

Moire
  The Waves you are seeing are called a Moire effect, itâ€™s the same effect you see through a screen door sometimes.
  It is caused by using a crt shader with scanlines and tube curvature and made worse when the resolution is limited. It is a thorny problem , and sometimes hard to get rid of at 1080, it is much less of a problem at 4k.
  Things which can help/fix the problem
    Reducing strength of scanlines, 
    Reducing or curvature or setting it to 0 will definitely fix it.
    If you keep using curvature using Integer scale in the shader parameters can sometimes help.

    If making own presets reference from crt-Base presets

  * Shader Passes in Sub Menu
  * Reload Last Preset
  * Original scaling Type?
  * MaxAbsolute scaling type?
  * Add Preset to beginning of chain (Autechre's request )
  * Next/Previous Shader sometimes uses different directories, probably related to shader_path in live shader rather than originally loaded preset
  * Replace Text, for shader type, game & core, content directory
    core_name
    game_name
    [shadertype], [gamename], [corename], [contentdirectory]
    * Check textures and use default if not found
  * Multiple references in one file for adding passes and parameter overrides
  * Add Shader Preset - In UI Add a shader preset to Concatenate passes at beginning of shader stack
  * Fix loss of current parameter values when retroarch goes from full screen to window
  * Fix MyTextureNameSize for textures
  * Add History other than OriginalHistory1 ...
  * Fix <texture>Size, only works for textures in DX11, 12, not Vulkan
  * Video Aspect Ratio which uses Monitor
  * Stop Reloading Shader multiple times on Save (Keep optional param)
  * GIF support
  * Check for alias used multiple times appears as semantic error now
  * global.x is semantic error if x not in global
